## **8. Publishing to PyPI**

To make your library publicly available, you can publish it to the Python Package Index (PyPI).

### **8.1. Building the Package**

1. **Install Build Tools:**

    ```bash
    pip install setuptools wheel twine
    ```

2. **Build the Package:**

    From your project root, run:

    ```bash
    python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
    ```

    This will create distribution files in the `dist/` directory.

### **8.2. Uploading to PyPI**

1. **Register an Account on PyPI:**

    If you haven't already, create an account on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/).

2. **Upload the Package:**

    ```bash
    twine upload dist/*
    ```

    You'll be prompted to enter your PyPI username and password.

3. **Verify Installation:**

    After uploading, install your package using:

    ```bash
    pip install enhanced_adaptive_dbscan
    ```

## **9. Continuous Integration (CI)**

Implement CI to automate testing and deployment, ensuring code quality and reliability.

### **9.1. GitHub Actions Workflow**

Create a GitHub Actions workflow to automate testing and building.

#### **`.github/workflows/python-package.yml`**

```yaml
name: Python package

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
