Algorithm Overview
==================

The Enhanced Adaptive DBSCAN algorithm builds upon the classic DBSCAN algorithm by introducing adaptive parameters and stability analysis to better handle datasets with varying densities.

Adaptive Parameter Selection
----------------------------

- **Local Density Estimation:** Computes the local density around each data point using k-nearest neighbors.
- **Adaptive Epsilon (ε):** Adjusts the ε parameter based on local density to capture clusters of varying densities.
- **Adaptive MinPts:** Modifies the MinPts parameter dynamically for each point to reflect local point density.

Stability-Based Cluster Selection
---------------------------------

- **Multi-Scale Clustering:** Performs clustering across multiple density scales.
- **Stability Analysis:** Evaluates clusters based on their persistence across scales, retaining only stable clusters.
- **Thresholding:** Clusters with stability above ``stability_threshold`` are retained.

Dynamic Cluster Centers
-----------------------

- **Centroid Updates:** Maintains and updates the centroids of clusters as new data points are assigned.
- **Representation Accuracy:** Ensures that the cluster centers accurately represent the current state of the clusters.

Partial Re-Clustering
---------------------

- **Affected Clusters Identification:** Detects clusters affected by new data points.
- **Efficient Updates:** Re-clusters only the affected clusters instead of the entire dataset, improving performance.

Incremental Clustering
----------------------

- **Real-Time Data Handling:** Supports the addition of new data points without reprocessing the entire dataset.
- **Incremental Updates:** Updates clusters and centroids incrementally to accommodate streaming data.

Algorithm Details
=================

1. **Adaptive Epsilon (ε) Calculation**

   The ε parameter is computed individually for each data point based on local density:

   - **Local Density Estimation:** For each point, compute the average distance to its k-nearest neighbors.
   - **Adaptive ε:** ε is inversely proportional to the local density:

     .. math::

         \epsilon_i = \frac{C}{\text{density}_i + \delta}

     where \( C \) is a scaling constant and \( \delta \) is a small value to prevent division by zero.

2. **Adaptive MinPts Calculation**

   MinPts is adjusted to reflect the local point density:

   - **Normalization:** Normalize local densities to a range between ``min_scaling`` and ``max_scaling``.
   - **Adaptive MinPts:** Assign MinPts to each point based on the normalized density.

3. **Stability Analysis**

   - **Multi-Scale Clustering:** Perform clustering at multiple scales by varying ε and MinPts within defined ranges.
   - **Cluster Stability:** A cluster's stability is determined by its presence across multiple scales.
   - **Thresholding:** Clusters with stability above ``stability_threshold`` are retained.

4. **Incremental Clustering**

   - **New Data Integration:** New data points are assigned to existing clusters if they fall within the adaptive ε of cluster members.
   - **Partial Re-Clustering:** Only affected clusters are re-clustered when new data significantly alters the cluster structure.

5. **Boundary Handling**

   - **Buffer Zones:** A buffer zone near the wafer boundary adjusts densities to account for edge effects.
   - **Density Adjustment:** Densities near boundaries are scaled to prevent artificial inflation or deflation.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q1: How does this algorithm differ from standard DBSCAN?**

The Enhanced Adaptive DBSCAN algorithm introduces adaptive parameters for ε and MinPts, allowing it to handle datasets with varying densities more effectively. It also incorporates stability analysis to retain robust clusters and supports incremental updates.

**Q2: Can I use this algorithm for non-wafer datasets?**

Yes, while it is tailored for semiconductor wafer defect analysis, the algorithm is generic and can be applied to any dataset where adaptive density-based clustering is beneficial.

**Q3: How do I choose the parameters like ``k``, ``density_scaling``, and ``stability_threshold``?**

- **``k``:** Typically set based on the expected local neighborhood size. A higher ``k`` smooths out density estimates.
- **``density_scaling``:** Adjusts the sensitivity of ε to local densities. Experimentation may be needed.
- **``stability_threshold``:** Determines how persistent a cluster must be across scales to be retained. A value between 0.5 and 0.7 is common.
